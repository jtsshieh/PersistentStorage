# Introduction

## Purpose

Garamia.PersistentStorage is a library that can be used by .NET developers to store data persistently while leaving the choice of how to store data persistently to the user. Garamia.PersistentStorage does not come with a StorageMethod. Therefore, installing a StorageMethod to implement Garamia.PersistentStorage is necessary to store data persistently.

## Features

- Use a queried storage controller, or a cached storage controller
- Switch between different storage methods
